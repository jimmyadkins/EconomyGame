# EconomyGame
Inspired by Victoria II, an attempt to make an economy simulation.

*Core Tenants*

1. Flexible pop system capable of handling natural growth in large + small populations, different cultures and ideas can be represented within pop system, pops can promote and demote depending on circumstance
2. Pops will automatically buy and sell goods in order to meet their needs
3. Promotion and demotion will affect pop ideals + needs
4. Trade cast between geographic regions such that local producers will be able to compete with massive industrial bases
5. Soulution for the liquidity crisis where the amount of money in the world is not enough for the exchange of all goods between all pops => some way to inject currency into the system as the worlds output increases without causing crippling inflation
